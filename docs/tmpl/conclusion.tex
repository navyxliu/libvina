\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
%Collaborative filtering assists recommender systems in learning user profiles and in suggesting potential preferences for users, but is limited by two problems - data sparsity and limited scalability.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient Collaborative Filtering
approach using Smoothing and Fusing (CFSF) to solve two primary
problems of CF - data sparsity and limited scalability. The
contributions of CFSF are two-fold. First, it offers a mechanism to
formulate the CF problem as a local prediction problem, by mapping CF
problem from the entire large-scale item-user matrix to a locally
reduced item-user matrix. This mechanism significantly decreases the
scale of CF problem. Second, for the locally reduced item-user matrix,
CFSF presents smoothing and fusing strategies that enable it to achieve
high levels of accuracy and scalability.

Currently, CFSF could be further improved. We will capture more aspects
of the data for improvement in accuracy, such as dates associated with
the ratings and attributes of items and users, which may reflect shifts
of user preferences. Moreover, we will study how CFSF can improve its
scalability in a parallel manner, as well as how it can keep $GIS$
up-to-date.
